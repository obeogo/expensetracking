This is my first JavaScript Project that I learned from JavaScript Mastery's Speechly Expense Tracker. It was a lot of fun learning from you. I look forward to coding with you again in future project. I recommend anyone who is looking to sharpen their JavaScript skills to subscribe to JavaScript Mastery Youtube channel: https://youtu.be/NnUFOWR_V4
